Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

## Error Handling

- The API uses standard HTTP status codes for error responses. Here are some common errors and their meanings:

- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid API key.

- 403 Forbidden: You do not have access to the requested resource.

- 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.

- 429 Too Many Requests: You have exceeded the rate limit.

- To handle errors effectively, check the response code and provide appropriate error messages to users.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

- Rate Limits: The API allows up to 100 requests per minute. Exceeding this limit will result in a 429 Too Many Requests error.

- Caching: Cache frequently requested data to reduce API calls and improve performance.

- Retry Logic: Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed requests.

- Data Filtering: Use query parameters to filter data and limit the size of responses.
